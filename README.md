# Azure AI Language Service with Bot Framework

Welcome to Azure AI Language Services with Bots workshop. 
 
In this OpenHack, youâ€™ll go through tasks that will help you master using Language services (CQA, CLU and Orchestration workflow ) and also build bots to connect to these services. This exercice can be done alone or in group and will take 4 hours. If you find any issue or have any remark, please do open a issue in the repository.


## Language Services
Azure AI Language is a cloud-based service that provides Natural Language Processing (NLP) features for understanding and analyzing text. Use this service to help build intelligent applications using the web-based Language Studio, REST APIs, and client libraries.

Available Features 

* Named Entity Recognition
* Personally identifying (PII) and health (PHI) information detection
* Language detection
* Sentiment Analysis and opinion mining
* Summarization
* Key phrase extraction
* Entity linking
* Text analytics for health
* Custom text classification
* Custom Named Entity Recognition (Custom NER)
* Conversational language understanding
* Orchestration workflow
* Question answering
* Custom text analytics for health

### Migrate from Text Analytics, QnA Maker, or Language Understanding (LUIS)
Azure AI Language unifies three individual language services in Azure AI services - Text Analytics, QnA Maker, and Language Understanding (LUIS). If you have been using these three services, you can easily migrate to the new Azure AI Language. For instructions see [Migrate to Azure AI Language].

### Create a Bot with the Bot Framework SDK 
Bots are software agents that can participate in conversational dialogs with human users. The Microsoft Bot Framework provides a comprehensive platform for building bots that can be delivered as cloud services through the Azure Bot Service.

## Pre Requisites

### Tools

1. an Azure subscription (and at least a dedicated resource group).
1. if you plan to run command from your computer: install [Az cli] or [Azure Powershell]
1. setup [BotFramework Emulator]
1. setup Git 
1. setup VS Code

### Clone Repository

To install Git, follow these steps:

1. Visit the official Git website at https://git-scm.com/downloads.
1. Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
1. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
Note: If you are using Visual Studio Code, Git is often bundled with the editor, so you may not need to install it separately.

Open the palette (SHIFT+CTRL+P) and run a Git: Clone command to clone the repository https://github.com/rjayapra/ai-services-hackathon to a local folder 
When the repository has been cloned, open the folder in Visual Studio code.
Wait while additional files are installed to support the C# code projects in the repo.

Note: If you are prompted to add required assets to build and debug, select Not Now.

### Create Language Resource:

1. Login to Azure Portal
1. Navigate to https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics
1. Select  custom features "Customer Question Answering"
1. Select appropriate subscription, resource group (create one if not exists), region, provide a name and pricing tier
1. For CQA select Azure search region set as "East US" and pricing tier as "Basic"
1. Read Responsible AI Note and click "Review + create".

Use Language Studio to try out the features without any code : [Language Studio]


## Lab Exercises:
|   Module   | Description |
| ---------- | --- |
| :point_down: [Module 1](BotWithCQA/) | __CQA__ <br> Create a Custom Question Answering project and build a bot to use the service. We will also deploy the bot to Azure. [BotWithCQA](BotWithCQA/) | 
| :point_down: [Module 2](CoreBotWithCLU/) |  __CLU__ <br> Create a Custom Language Understanding project and build a bot to use the service. We will also deploy the bot to Azure.[CoreBotWithCLU](CoreBotWithCLU/) |
| :point_down: [Module 3](OrchestrationWorkflowBot/) | __Orchestration workflow__ <br> Create a Orchestration workflow project and use the CQA and CLU projects to train the model and create a deployment. Build a bot to use the service. We will also deploy the bot to Azure. [OrchestrationWorkflowBot](OrchestrationWorkflowBot/) |
| :point_down: [Module 4](custom-storage-bot/) | __Custom Storage bot__ <br> Understand the different storage options - Memory, Blob storage and CosmosDB storage.[custom-storage-bot](custom-storage-bot/) |
| :point_down: [Module 5](state-management-bot/) | __State management bot__ <br> Store the user and conversation state in Memory or custom storage. State store can be used to understand the user interactions [state-management-bot](state-management-bot/) |
| :point_down: [Module 6](BotMonitoring/) | __Bot Monitoring__ <br> Add telemetry to bot solution, use metrics and logs to understand the status of bots and troubleshoot [BotMonitoring](BotMonitoring/) |
| :point_down: [Module 7](inspection-bot/) | __Debugging__ <br> Understand different options/techniques to debug a bot. Use this example to invoke inspection middleware to debug the bot. [inspection-bot](inspection-bot/) |
| :point_down: [Module 8](BotTests/) |  __Unit Testing__ <br> Add unit tests to bot. Refer this sample core bot example to add test cases and validate the bot [BotTests](BotTests/) |
| :point_down: [Module 9](middleware-multilingual-bot/) | __Middleware__ <br> Bots can use the inbuilt middleware like logging, telemetry , translation etc., before or after every turns. Also can use custom middleware created as well. In this example we will try to use a translation service and invoke the translation middleware on configured languages.
